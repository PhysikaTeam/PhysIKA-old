/*
 * Driver class uses plugin mechanism  to support customization during simulation
 * The user can inherit a subclass of DriverPluginBase and define the customized 
 * methods therein. These methods can be called in methods of driver class.
 * The default virtual methods of driver plugin are called in specific timing during
 * simulation in DriverBase, e.g., onBeginFrame() is called at the begining of each
 * frame. The user could define more methods for their plugin subclasses and call them
 * wherever they want in their driver subclasses.
 * Example usage:
 * Define a plugin subclass which implements the onBeginFrame() method by popping out a 
 * window at the begining of each frame for rendering purpose.
 *
 * Physika drivers allow for restarting the simulation from any frame, provided that the
 * simulation data of that frame has been written to file in previous simulation.
 * To implement restart support in subclass of DriverBase, you need to:
 * 1. Implement the write() method where the image of driver class in memory is written to file
 * 2. Implement the read() method where the status of driver class is loadded from file
 * 3. Implement the initSimulationData() method, in which the read() method is called to load driver status
 *    of restart frame into memory
 * Note:
 * 1. If you override the default run() in your subclass, be sure to call initSimulationData() at the begining of
 *    your run() method such that restart works properly
 * 2. In default restart only works if you run the simulation by calling run(), if you run simulation through
 *    advanceFrame() or advanceStep(), you need to call initSimulationData() before entering simulation loop
 * 3. Be sure to return correct value in your withRestartSupport() method to inform the user whether restart
 *    is supported in your driver
 * 
 * For users of drivers: call setRestartFrame() before calling run()
