hey guys heres all the ranges for the ninja model, 20 ranges and 300 frames....Phew!!

you may need to scale or rotate the model and change animation speeds for various 3D game engines...

Please check the numbers carefully cus they dont follow any order and in between ranges often skip a few frames, this as how I achieved certain moves in Character FX its not a mistake :)

1-14	Walk (normal)
15-30	Stealth Walk
32-44	Punch and swipe sword
45-59	Swipe and spin sword
60-68	Overhead twohanded downswipe
69-72	Up to block position (play backwards to lower sword if you want)
73-83	Forward kick
84-93	Pick up from floor (or down to crouch at frame 87)
94-102	Jump
103-111	Jump without height (for programmer controlled jumps)
112-125	High jump to Sword Kill (Finish em off move??)
126-133	Side Kick
134-145	Spinning Sword attack (might wanna speed this up in game)
146-158	Backflip
159-165	Climb wall
166-173	Death 1 - Fall back onto ground
174-182	Death 2 - Fall forward onto ground
184-205	Idle 1 - Breathe heavily

Note for Irrlicht: Irrlicht uses a 0-based frame index. So subtract 1 from each of the loops!
