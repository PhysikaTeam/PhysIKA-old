BUILD DEPENDENCIES

- COLLADA DOM (document object model) v1.4.1
  http://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/DOM_guide:_Setting_up

- libxml2

- iconv

A standard "ccmake ." while in the root of the OSG source will expose
two CMake variables: COLLADA_INCLUDE_DIR and COLLADA_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY (or
COLLADA_STATIC_LIBRARY). Using these two variables correctly can be a bit
tricky (especially as the "right" and "wrong" ways to use Collada are hard to
define), but I will briefly explain them below.

  COLLADA_INCLUDE_DIR: This variable wants the path where it can
  find the COLLADA headers. On most systems this will be something
  like /usr/include or /usr/include/collada.

  COLLADA_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY (or COLLADA_STATIC_LIBRARY): This variable is asking
  for the FULL PATH to the file libcollada_dom.so (or libcollada_dom.a). As
  long as it can find this file, the OSG Collada ReaderWriter should build
  just fine.
