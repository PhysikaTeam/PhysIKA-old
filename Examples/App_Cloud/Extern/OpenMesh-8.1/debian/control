Package: libopenmesh
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: OpenMesh is a generic and efficient data structure for representing
 and manipulating polygonal meshes. OpenMesh provides the following features:
 .
  * Representation of arbitrary polygonal and pure triangle meshes.
  * Explicit representation of vertices, halfedges, edges and faces.
  * Fast neighborhood access, especially the one-ring neighborhood.
  * Highly customizable.
 .
 This package contains the shared library needed to run programs using
 OpenMesh.
