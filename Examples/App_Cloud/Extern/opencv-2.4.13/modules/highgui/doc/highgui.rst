highgui. High-level GUI and Media I/O
*************************************

While OpenCV was designed for use in full-scale
applications and can be used within functionally rich UI frameworks (such as Qt*, WinForms*, or Cocoa*) or without any UI at all, sometimes there it is required to try functionality quickly and visualize the results. This is what the HighGUI module has been designed for.

It provides easy interface to:

* Create and manipulate windows that can display images and "remember" their content (no need to handle repaint events from OS).
* Add trackbars to the windows, handle simple mouse events as well as keyboard commands.
* Read and write images to/from disk or memory.
* Read video from camera or file and write video to a file.
