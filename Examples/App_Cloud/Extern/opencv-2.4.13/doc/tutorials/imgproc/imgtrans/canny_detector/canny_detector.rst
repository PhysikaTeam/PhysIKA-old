Goal
=====

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

.. container:: enumeratevisibleitemswithsquare

   * Use the OpenCV function :canny:`Canny <>` to implement the Canny Edge Detector.

Theory
=======

#. The *Canny Edge detector* was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Also known to many as the *optimal detector*, Canny algorithm aims to satisfy three main criteria:

   * **Low error rate:** Meaning a good detection of only existent edges.
   * **Good localization:** The distance between edge pixels detected and real edge pixels have to be minimized.
   * **Minimal response:** Only one detector response per edge.

Steps
------

#. Filter out any noise. The Gaussian filter is used for this purpose. An example of a Gaussian kernel of :math:`size = 5` that might be used is shown below:

   .. math::

      K = \dfrac{1}{159}\begin{bmatrix}
                2 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 2 \\
                4 & 9 & 12 & 9 & 4 \\
                5 & 12 & 15 & 12 & 5 \\
                4 & 9 & 12 & 9 & 4 \\
                2 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 2
                        \end{bmatrix}


#. Find the intensity gradient of the image. For this, we follow a procedure analogous to Sobel:

   a. Apply a pair of convolution masks (in :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions:

      .. math::

         G_{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
         -1 & 0 & +1  \\
         -2 & 0 & +2  \\
         -1 & 0 & +1
         \end{bmatrix}

         G_{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
         -1 & -2 & -1  \\
         0 & 0 & 0  \\
         +1 & +2 & +1
         \end{bmatrix}

   b. Find the gradient strength and direction with:

      .. math::
         \begin{array}{l}
         G = \sqrt{ G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2} } \\
         \theta = \arctan(\dfrac{ G_{y} }{ G_{x} })
         \end{array}

      The direction is rounded to one of four possible angles (namely 0, 45, 90 or 135)

#. *Non-maximum* suppression is applied. This removes pixels  that are not considered to be part of an edge. Hence, only thin lines (candidate edges) will remain.

#. *Hysteresis*: The final step. Canny does use two thresholds (upper and lower):

   a. If a pixel gradient is higher than the *upper* threshold, the pixel is accepted as an edge
   b. If a pixel gradient value is below the *lower* threshold, then it is rejected.
   c. If the pixel gradient is between the two thresholds, then it will be accepted only if it is connected to a pixel that is above the *upper* threshold.

   Canny recommended a *upper*:*lower* ratio between 2:1 and 3:1.

#. For more details, you can always consult your favorite Computer Vision book.

Code
=====

#. **What does this program do?**

   * Asks the user to enter a numerical value to set the lower threshold for our *Canny Edge Detector* (by means of a Trackbar)
   * Applies the *Canny Detector* and generates a **mask** (bright lines representing the edges on a black background).
   * Applies the mask obtained on the original image and display it in a window.

.. code-block::  cpp

   #include "opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp"
   #include "opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp"
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   using namespace cv;

   /// Global variables

   {
     /// Reduce noise with a kernel 3x3
     blur( src_gray, detected_edges, Size(3,3) );

     /// Canny detector
     Canny( detected_edges, detected_edges, lowThreshold, lowThreshold*ratio, kernel_size );

     /// Using Canny's output as a mask, we display our result
     dst = Scalar::all(0);

     src.copyTo( dst, detected_edges);
     imshow( window_name, dst );
    }


   /** @function main */

     /// Create a Trackbar for user to enter threshold
     createTrackbar( "Min Threshold:", window_name, &lowThreshold, max_lowThreshold, CannyThreshold );

     /// Show the image
     CannyThreshold(0, 0);

     /// Wait until user exit program by pressing a key
     waitKey(0);

     return 0;
     }

Explanation
============

#. Create some needed variables:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      Mat src, src_gray;
      Mat dst, detected_edges;

      int edgeThresh = 1;
      int lowThreshold;
      int const max_lowThreshold = 100;
      int ratio = 3;
      int kernel_size = 3;
      char* window_name = "Edge Map";

    Note the following:

    a. We establish a ratio of lower:upper threshold of 3:1 (with the variable *ratio*)
    b. We set the kernel size of :math:`3` (for the Sobel operations to be performed internally by the Canny function)
    c. We set a maximum value for the lower Threshold of :math:`100`.


#. Loads the source image:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      /// Load an image
      src = imread( argv[1] );

      if( !src.data )
        { return -1; }

#. Create a matrix of the same type and size of *src* (to be *dst*)

   .. code-block:: cpp

      dst.create( src.size(), src.type() );

#. Convert the image to grayscale (using the function :cvt_color:`cvtColor <>`:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      cvtColor( src, src_gray, CV_BGR2GRAY );

#. Create a window to display the results

   .. code-block:: cpp

      namedWindow( window_name, CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );

#. Create a Trackbar for the user to enter the lower threshold for our Canny detector:

   .. code-block:: cpp

     createTrackbar( "Min Threshold:", window_name, &lowThreshold, max_lowThreshold, CannyThreshold );

   Observe the following:

   a. The variable to be controlled by the Trackbar is *lowThreshold* with a limit of *max_lowThreshold* (which we set to 100 previously)
   b. Each time the Trackbar registers an action, the callback function *CannyThreshold* will be invoked.

#. Let's check the *CannyThreshold* function, step by step:

   a. First, we blur the image with a filter of kernel size 3:

      .. code-block:: cpp

         blur( src_gray, detected_edges, Size(3,3) );

   b. Second, we apply the OpenCV function :canny:`Canny <>`:

      .. code-block:: cpp

        Canny( detected_edges, detected_edges, lowThreshold, lowThreshold*ratio, kernel_size );

      where the arguments are:

      * *detected_edges*: Source image, grayscale
      * *detected_edges*: Output of the detector (can be the same as the input)
      * *lowThreshold*: The value entered by the user moving the Trackbar
      * *highThreshold*: Set in the program as three times the lower threshold (following Canny's recommendation)
      * *kernel_size*: We defined it to be 3 (the size of the Sobel kernel to be used internally)

#. We fill a *dst* image with zeros (meaning the image is completely black).

   .. code-block:: cpp

      dst = Scalar::all(0);

#. Finally, we will use the function :copy_to:`copyTo <>` to map only the areas of the image that are identified as edges (on a black background).

   .. code-block:: cpp

      src.copyTo( dst, detected_edges);

   :copy_to:`copyTo <>` copy the *src* image onto *dst*. However, it will only copy the pixels in the locations where they have non-zero values. Since the output of the Canny detector is the edge contours on a black background, the resulting *dst* will be black in all the area but the detected edges.

#. We display our result:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      imshow( window_name, dst );

Result
=======

* After compiling the code above, we can run it giving as argument the path to an image. For example, using as an input the following image:

   .. image:: images/Canny_Detector_Tutorial_Original_Image.jpg
           :alt: Original test image
           :width: 200pt
           :align: center

* Moving the slider, trying different threshold, we obtain the following result:

   .. image:: images/Canny_Detector_Tutorial_Result.jpg
           :alt: Result after running Canny
           :width: 200pt
           :align: center

* Notice how the image is superposed to the black background on the edge regions.
