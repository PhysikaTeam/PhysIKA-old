.. _generic_corner_detector:

Creating yor own corner detector
********************************

Goal
=====

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

.. container:: enumeratevisibleitemswithsquare

   * Use the OpenCV function :corner_eigenvals_and_vecs:`cornerEigenValsAndVecs <>` to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to determine if a pixel is a corner.
   * Use the OpenCV function :corner_min_eigenval:`cornerMinEigenVal <>` to find the minimum eigenvalues for corner detection.
   * To implement our own version of the Harris detector as well as the Shi-Tomasi detector, by using the two functions above.
