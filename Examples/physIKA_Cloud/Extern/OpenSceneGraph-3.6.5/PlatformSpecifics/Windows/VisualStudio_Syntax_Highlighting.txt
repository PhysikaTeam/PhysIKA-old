Mapping extensionless header files to C++ in Visual Studio
=============================================================================

Previous versions of the OSG included registry files which enabled syntax 
highlighting for OSG's extensionless headers in Visual Studio. These are not 
needed anymore, because starting with Visual Studio 2002 (7.0), there is a 
setting that will map extensionless files to a certain language in the 
options. This also works for the Express Editions.

1. Go to Tools-Options.
2. Open the Text Editor section, and click on File Extension.
3. At the bottom of the window, check the Map Extensionless Files To 
   checkbox, and select Microsoft Visual C++ in the list to the right.

Note that if you use this feature for other languages, you will have to 
change it when needed. If that is too cumbersome you may want to generate 
the registry files and do it that way instead. Please see the 
.reg files in previous versions of OSG in the VisualStudio directory for 
a guide on how to do that (hint: check the location of the registry key
to make sure the added values end up in the right place for your version
of Visual Studio).
